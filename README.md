# Shannon
Coding Theory Algorithms over Shannon based Communication Channels. 

## Motivation 
Coding theory offers and interesting intersection between computer science and mathematics that isn't often seen. This repository will serve as a learning tool for myself (and others) where common coding theory algorithms can be simulated using a convenient CLI. Focus will be placed on understanding the algorithms, their motivations as well as their performance.
